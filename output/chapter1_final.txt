## The Gates of Morning: Chapter 1 - The Canoe Builder

Dick perched on a coral ledge, his gaze fixed on the southern horizon.  Behind him, the ocean roared, its spray whipped into a frenzy by the wind.  In front, the lagoon of Karolin shimmered, a vast expanse of calm, blue water, dotted with fishing gulls.  It was a breathtaking scene, and it was *his*.  He'd only arrived yesterday, but this tranquil lagoon, ringed by forty miles of coral, was now his domain.

The beach bustled with activity: women fishing, children playing, people tending their gardens.  They were all his people now. The canoes pulled up on the sand, the empty houses – once home to war canoes – were all his.

But as he looked from the lagoon to the empty canoe houses, a frown creased his brow. He turned, facing the crashing waves and the northern sea. Beyond the horizon, invisible but ever-present in his thoughts, lay Palm Tree Island.  Beautiful as a dream, it was also a place teeming with danger.

Little Tari, the net-maker's son, watched him from the coral.  Tari didn't understand much about the world, but he knew Karolin's men were gone, leaving the women and children vulnerable. Then, yesterday, a strange boat had arrived, carrying Dick and Katafa, a girl lost at sea years ago.  The women believed they were sent by the gods, to be their leader.

Tari, curious and innocent, blurted out the question: "Taori," he asked, "who are you?"

Dick couldn't explain everything. The name "Dick Lestrange," his childhood, were fading memories.  He'd been shipwrecked on Palm Tree with an old sailor named Kearney, who taught him to survive. Then Katafa arrived, and together they escaped the violent Melanesians who had invaded the island, burning the ship and claiming the land.

The past felt hazy, a blend of sun-drenched days and violent storms, the only clear memories were those shared with Katafa. Kearney was almost forgotten, except for the toy ships he'd made.

"I am Taori," Dick told Tari. "Why do you ask?"

"I don't know," Tari replied, his attention already diverted by a group of children hauling in a net.

Dick’s gaze returned to the north.  The child's question stirred him. He saw the burning schooner, his escape with Katafa, their arrival at Karolin.  He saw the welcoming faces, the islanders’ belief that he was sent by the gods.  But the memory of those violent men, the ones he’d escaped, tainted the beauty of the scene.

He wasn't afraid *yet*.  The men on Palm Tree had no canoes… but they would build them.  They'd see the lagoon's reflection in the sky, just as he had, and they would come. It might take time, but they would come.

He was a Kanaka, a native, yet the white man within him remained. He could plan, anticipate, imagine. That's why he’d sent for Aioma, Palia, and Tafata, skilled canoe builders, and why the sight of so many young men, ready for war, filled him with a grim determination.  Underlying everything, fueling his courage, was his love for Katafa – a love threatened by the looming danger.

War canoes?  Would he defend the lagoon, or strike first?  He wasn't sure.

A hand touched his shoulder. It was Katafa. A strand of her dark hair, free from its vine-binding, danced in the breeze. Her luminous eyes were fixed on the north.

"Look," she whispered.

Palm Tree, usually hidden, was visible through a mirage.  Last night they'd seen it, and now it was reappearing, a hazy smudge on the horizon, slowly resolving into the island's breathtaking beauty.

They stood silently, the memory of their escape flooding back – the terrifying figures on the beach, the wind in their sails, the cries of the enraged Melanesians.  The idyllic image of the island was a cruel deception, hiding the lurking evil.

Dick’s nostrils flared, his eyes burning with hate. They’d threatened him, yes, but they’d threatened Katafa – and that was everything.  They would come.  He knew it. They'd build canoes, see the lagoon's reflection, and come for the women of Karolin.

The vision of Palm Tree faded.  Katafa pointed to a canoe approaching from the south – the canoe carrying the canoe builders.  Leaving the coral, they walked towards the beach, ready to face the future.
